**Note:** This repository contains the source code for module 12 homework of GA Tech's 2022 Coding Bootcamp.

## Description ##

The goal of this assignment is to create an SQL database that stores various information about employees, their roles, salaries, and so on.  Putting all of this information into a single application helps keep everything neat and orderly, and allows 
for information to be updated easily if needed.  I have not finished yet, so far i have created the necessary files, installed the required packages, and finished the schema.sql and seeds.sql files.  I still have to finish the server.js logic, which i will finish when I have time.
